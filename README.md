# Fōrm

A web-based project with the sole purpose of teaching you how to improve your technique when performing an exercise.




## Overview

It does this through a camera with the use of the python library OpenCV (computer vision) which tracks the user's joints, comparing their movement with already loaded footage from which the AI model bases its judgement. The AI will spot any major differences between the user's technique and the dataset and will point out what is wrong and what needs to be done in order to reach the desired stance / movement.
## Tech Stack

**IA:** Python 3, OpenCV
